# Multithreaded-Webserver
************************Readme file for the project ""MULTITHREADED WEBSERVER""**************************

The source file is written in JAVA and the following steps needs to be followed to execute the code:
1. Create a JAVA Project with the Class name "WebServer" in Eclipse and copy all these files in the project folder in Eclipse.
	GIFimage.gif
	HTMLpage.html
	JPEGimage.jpg
	Textfile.txt
	WebServer.java
2. The source file is then to be compiled and it will ask for the "port number" as input field.
3. Enter any number greater than 1024. For example take 2000 as port number.
4. Open "Internet Edge 10" browser and type "http://localhost:2000/filename.filetype".(Developed based on standards of Internet Edge on Windows 10. Test using default windows browser)
   For example: http://localhost:2000/JPEGimage.jpg
   (Standards may vary depends on browsers and preferred is Internet Explorer)
5. You can observe the "Thread Count" also in the Console of Eclipse.
6. If you give undefined file name, it will throw you "File name not found" message on the web page. 
7. I attached screen shots of my test cases in this zip folder.
Note: If the page is refreshing automatically, it will create a new thread for each Refresh.
